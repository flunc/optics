# Flunc Optics

![build status](https://travis-ci.org/flunc/optics.svg?branch=master)

This library is an implementation of profunctor optics using JS, heavily
influenced by the [PureScript Profunctor Lenses][1] and [Kmett's Lens][2]
libraries.

The project is still very young and as such, documentation is currently
a work-in-progress.

Contributions welcome!
