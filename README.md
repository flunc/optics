# Flunc Optics

[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/flunc/optics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/flunc/optics)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/flunc-optics.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flunc-optics)

This library is an implementation of profunctor optics using JS, heavily
influenced by the [PureScript Profunctor Lenses][1] and [Kmett's Lens][2]
libraries.

```
npm install flunc-optics
```

The project is still very young and as such, documentation is currently
a work-in-progress.

Contributions welcome!
